# 🦠 COVID-19 Healthy Diet 

## 📌 Overview
This project explores the relationship between **dietary habits** and **COVID-19 outcomes** across different countries. Using **SQL** for data processing and **Power BI** for visualization, the project aims to uncover insights on how **obesity, malnutrition, and food consumption patterns** impact COVID-19 recovery, infection, and mortality rates.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the impact of **obesity and malnutrition** on COVID-19 outcomes.
- Identify **correlations** between dietary patterns and recovery/mortality rates.
- Develop **interactive Power BI dashboards** for data visualization.
- Improve **BI skills** including **data collection, preparation, and visualization**.

## 📊 Data Sources
- **COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset** *(Kaggle)*
  - [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset)
- **Country Coordinates Dataset** *(Kaggle)*
  - [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/latitude-and-longitude-for-every-country-and-state)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **SQL** (Data Extraction & Processing)
- **Power BI** (Data Visualization & Dashboarding)
- **Excel** (Data Cleaning & Preparation)

## 🔍 Key Analytical Questions
1. How does **obesity** impact **COVID-19 recovery, infection, and mortality rates**?
2. Does **malnutrition** influence **COVID-19 severity and recovery rates**?
3. How do **different food consumption patterns** affect **COVID-19 outcomes**?
4. Are there **geographical patterns** in the relationship between diet and COVID-19?

## 📂 Project Workflow
### **1️⃣ Data Collection**
- Gathered COVID-19 dietary impact data from **Kaggle**.
- Retrieved **latitude & longitude** for countries for **geo-visualization**.

### **2️⃣ Data Preparation**
- Merged datasets & **cleaned missing/invalid values**.
- Standardized country names across datasets.
- Created a **master dataset** combining key factors.

### **3️⃣ Data Analysis & Visualization**
- **Calculated key measures**: 
  - Recovery Rate, Mortality Rate, Active Cases.
  - Average Obesity Rate, Malnutrition Rate, Infection Rate.
- **Power BI Dashboards**:
  - Interactive charts showing relationships between diet and COVID-19.
  - Heatmaps, bar charts, scatter plots for deeper insights.

## 📈 Insights & Findings
- **Obesity negatively affects** COVID-19 recovery, leading to **higher mortality rates**.
- **Countries with lower malnutrition rates** tend to have **better recovery rates**.
- **Higher obesity rates correlate with higher infection rates**.
- Some **low-obesity countries still have poor recovery rates**, likely due to **other factors** like healthcare policies and vaccination.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Automate **data updates** with **real-time API integration**.
- Implement **machine learning** to predict COVID-19 recovery trends.
- Expand analysis to **other health-related datasets**.
